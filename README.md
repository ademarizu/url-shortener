# url-shortener
A Simple Url Shortener.

This is the simplest Url Shortner I could think of. It's fully implemented using Python and a few libs.

* tornado
* simplejson
* redis

## Installing
Just download this code or git clone it.

Execute pip install -r requirements.pip

python -m urlshrtnr -d <Your Domain> -a <Redis Address>

If you need more options, just execute python -m urlshrtnr -h to list them.

Ok, you're up and running.
